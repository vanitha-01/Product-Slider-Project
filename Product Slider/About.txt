The script generally includes the following elements:

1.Variables to store the product data and the current slide index
2.Event handlers (e.g. on arrow click or dot click) to update the current slide index and call the sliding function
3.A function to slide through the products based on the current slide index and update the product cart on the page
4.Elements (e.g. arrows or dots) for the user to navigate through the products
5.The ability to slide through the products automatically by using setInterval() function
6.The ability to stop the sliding on hover and resume on leaving.

In addition, the script should be able to handle dynamic data changes, such as adding or removing products from the cart, without breaking the sliding functionality. 
It can also have a responsive design, that means it should adjust itself according to the screen size. It can also have the option to show the products in a grid
view and also a list view. In summary, a Product Cart Slider in JavaScript provides a visually appealing and interactive way for users to navigate through a product 
cart,and it can be easily integrated into e-commerce websites, online shops, and other web applications where a product cart is required.
